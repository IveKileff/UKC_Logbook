Moves for the Masses,6a+  **,Lead dog,MattL80,"- use left foot to brace off to get off the ground
- when moving the left foot up to the first ledge - use the undercling just above the sloper for the right hand.
- when moving up from here drop right hand down to sloper, the first time I made this move I got my weight over my left foot and could reach up to the flake direct (neater); alternatively, there are also holds on the right that I used on another attempt. 
- I think there are two ways to progress past the jug to the corner - today I managed it by lay backing to the left, getting my feet up on the right and on the flake, moving my right hand up to the side pull and then moving up to the jug.  I think last time I climbed this I moved my feet out left and maybe just bunched up and bumped my left hand up for the jug?
- once I've got this the rest is relatively straightforward!",23/Aug/20,Hedbury
