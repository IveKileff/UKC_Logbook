# UKC_Logbook
A few variations of Python programs to visualise lead climbs, with data having been downloaded from individual UKC climbing logbook in csv format.

The programs do the same thing, they're just structured differently.  

For this program to work you need:
  - Python 3.7 or later installed 
  - plotly installed

Depending on which program you're using:
  - to save your UKC logbook as "ukc_logbook.csv" in the same directory as "logbook_4.py", or:
  - to save your UKC logbook as "ukc_logbook.csv" in the same directory as "logbook_5.py" and "logbook_5_build_data.py"
  - to save your UKC logbook as "ukc_logbook.csv" in the same directory as "logbook_lead.py"
