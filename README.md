# UKC_Logbook
A few Python programs to visualise lead climbs, with data having been downloaded from individual UKC climbing logbook in csv format.

The programs have been saved in a sequential order as I improved coding and functionality, with code also being refactored along the way.  Because of this only "logbook_4_single_chart.py" and "logbook_5_single_chart.py" show all relevant data in the chart.

For this program to work you need:
  - Python 3.7 or later installed 
  - plotly installed
  - to save your UKC logbook as "ukc_logbook.csv" in the same directory as "logbook_4_single_chart.py", or:
  - to save your UKC logbook as "ukc_logbook.csv" in the same directory as "logbook_5_single_chart.py" and "logbook_5_build_data.py"
