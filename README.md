# UKC_Logbook
A few Python programs to visualise lead climbs, with data having been downloaded from individual UKC climbing logbook in csv format.

The programs have been saved in a sequential order as I improved coding and functionality, with code also being refactored along the way.  Because of this currently only logbook_4_single_chart shows all relevant data in the chart
