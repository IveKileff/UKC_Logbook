# UKC_Logbook
A few Python programs to visualise lead climbs, with data having been downloaded from individual UKC climbing logbook in csv format.

The programs have been saved in a sequential order as I improved coding and functionality, with code also being refactored along the way.  Because of this currently only logbook_4_single_chart shows all relevant data in the chart

For this program to work you need:
  Python 3.7 or later installed 
  plotly installed
  save your UKC logbook as "ukc_logbook.csv" in the same directory as "logbook_4_single_chart.py"
